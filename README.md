# myShortcuts
simple app for mozilla firerfox

Link for app: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/my-shortcuts/

I created this app for design purposes and am happy with the result. I'd like to share it here. I suggest pinning it to the taskbar for a better experience. 
When you double-click, you can add links and build from there. Adjust the background if needed. Since themes follow different patterns, I fixed as much as possible. i hope u like it.
